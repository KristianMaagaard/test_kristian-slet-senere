# Realtime Quiz App

A simple quiz similar to Kahoot. Allows a host to create a session with image-based questions and four answer choices. Players join with a name, earn points based on speed, and proceed through questions automatically. The host can view the scoreboard and per-question statistics of correct and wrong answers.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open `public/host.html` for the instructor and `public/player.html` for players.
